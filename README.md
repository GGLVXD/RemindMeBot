This is the repository for u/RemindMeBot on reddit. It's a reminder bot that you can trigger with a comment or message and it will send you a reminder message the specified time period later. You can find instructions on how to use the bot [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/).

I took over running u/RemindMeBot from u/RemindMeBotWrangler in early 2019 and fully rewrote the code.

I use both [dateparser](https://github.com/scrapinghub/dateparser) and [parsedatetime](https://github.com/bear/parsedatetime) to parse date strings, though I use a [custom branch of dateparser](https://github.com/Watchful1/dateparser) with a few small modifications. I use [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) backed by sqlite for storing data. I use a custom python logging library [DiscordLogging](https://github.com/Watchful1/DiscordLogging) to log error messages to a discord channel. Lastly I use praw via another custom library [PrawWrapper](https://github.com/Watchful1/PrawWrapper) that allows me to set up a mock reddit instance for unit testing.
